# Welcome

Welcome to my personal website! I am a PhD student in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. My research interests lie in the intersection of machine learning, computer vision, and natural language processing. I am particularly interested in developing models that can understand and generate human language. I am advised by [Prof. Julia Hockenmaier](https://juliahmr.cs.illinois.edu/).
