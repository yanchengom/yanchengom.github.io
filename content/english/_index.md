This file is left intentionally empty by default to be backwards compatible with the initial theme setup.

Although the theme has advanced a little bit and it now allows to specify the content on the main page (even if the list of posts/articles is not intended).
This can be:
- with the list of posts/articles (default: `mainSections = ["post"]) or
- without the list of posts/articles (by setting `mainSections = [""]`)

Markdown supported, ie:

```
# Welcome

- Hugo :rocket:
- Hugo theme :rocket:

Don't forget to check the README.md file!
```

Remember that you can also specify a section header for the posts below by configuring the `mainSectionsTitle` parameter in the front matter of this file.

# Welcome

Welcome to my personal website! I am a PhD student in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. My research interests lie in the intersection of machine learning, computer vision, and natural language processing. I am particularly interested in developing models that can understand and generate human language. I am advised by [Prof. Julia Hockenmaier](https://juliahmr.cs.illinois.edu/).
